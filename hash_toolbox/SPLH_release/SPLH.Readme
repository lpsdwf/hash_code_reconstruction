Information of 1M dataset

SIFT_trndata       1M samples, 128 dim, for training and construct hash table;
SIFT_vaddata       10K samples, 128 dim, can be used for validation;
SIFT_tstdata        10K samples, 128 dim, can be used for test;
KNN_info          ground truth computed between SIFT_tstdata and SIFT_trndata (SIFT_tstdata as query samples and SIFT_trndata as queried database)
                  returning 2 percentile points (20K from 1M) closest to a query.
-	knn_p2     matrix of 10k by 20K indicates the index of nearest neighbors using l2 distance
-	dis_p2     matrix of 10k by 20K indicates the distance of nearest neighbors using l2 distance

for example:
KNN_info. dis_p2(1001,1) = norm(SIFT_tstdata(1001,:)- SIFT_trndata(KNN_info. knn_p2(1001,1),:));



Usage of the codes

S3PLH_demo.m
This is the demo for semi-supervised version of the sequential projection learning based hashing. It will generate similar results as that presented in
the ICML paper Figure 3(a) (b) and Figure 5(a) (b)

USPLH_demo.m
This is the demo for unsupervised version of the sequential projection learning based hashing. It will generate the results of 48-bits. If you vary the
bits from 12 to 64. It should generate the similar results as presented in Figure 6 of the ICML paper.

 
The comparison with Spectral Hashing is also provided. Also this package uses some codes from the Spectral Hashing paper. Thanks for providing 
the codes of SH. 

Note that this algorithm is patented. Please use it only for research purpose. Contact the author of the codes if you want to apply to any commercial applications. Thanks.
